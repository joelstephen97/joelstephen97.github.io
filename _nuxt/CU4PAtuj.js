From finding QBasic and C++ and making the PC make weird system noises to tearing apart and trying to duplicate/modify HTML in all the late 2000&#39;s websites, I knew pretty well that coding was something that I wanted to do. Fast forward to now and I have my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and a few years of solid full-stack experience and nothing has diminished my interest towards programming. Any challenge and I&#39;m instantly in the headspace of trying to find a way to resolve an issue. Now I have coding experience in PHP, plenty of scripting, coding and testing experience in Python and experience with Front-end, from prototyping in FIGMA to CSS and HTML. The journey however is a long way from over and I look constantly for new and exciting ideas, technologies and companies to be part of and improve my skills and make an impact while am at it.</p></section>',2),h=[m],p=a({__name:"AboutMe",setup(t){return(n,s)=>(e(),o("div",r,h))}}),g=l(p,[["__scopeId","data-v-0849073d"]]),_=a({__name:"about-me",setup(t){return(n,s)=>{const i=g;return e(),c(i)}}});export{_ as default};
