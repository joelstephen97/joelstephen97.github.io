      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Coding has always been something that has been interesting to me. From finding QBasic and C++ and making the PC make weird system noises to tearing apart and trying to duplicate/modify HTML in all the late 2000's websites, I knew pretty well that coding was something that I wanted to do. Fast forward to now and I have my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and a few years of solid full-stack experience and nothing has diminished my interest towards programming. Any challenge and I'm instantly in the headspace of trying to find a way to resolve an issue. Now I have coding experience in PHP, plenty of scripting, coding and testing experience in Python and experience with Front-end, from prototyping in FIGMA to CSS and HTML. The journey however is a long way from over and I look constantly for new and exciting ideas, technologies and companies to be part of and improve my skills and make an impact while am at it.</p>
